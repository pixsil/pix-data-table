# full working vuejs data page

including:
- vuejs components: pix-data-table and pix-data-table-card
- dataLoader.js

[WIP]

Full data implementation for VueJS3. Got an instant working data table and also one wrapped in a card.

Based on Boostrap 4 (maybe works also for 5?)

Depenencies:
  - pix search trait
  - b-components (not online yet)
  - laravel-vue-pagination (https://laravel-vue-pagination.org/guide/install.html)
